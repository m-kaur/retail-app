## Future Improvements

1. I'd love to experiment with other libraries and implement image zoom in feature on hover in image carousal. Current implementation does it in lighbox but not on primary image.

2. Implemented user interface is not pixel perfect. Would improve it more by using photoshop.

3. Currently http call is fetching data form JSON file but real world implementation would be from some service, so leading pattern may need some change.

4. Current test case coverage is not complete, would spend more time on implementating end to end test.
